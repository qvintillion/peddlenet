🛡️🎪🔧 CRITICAL: Development Stability + Room Navigation + Hydration Fixes

Major development workflow protection, enhanced user experience, and technical stability improvements.

🛡️ CRITICAL: Enhanced Deployment Safety
• Problem: Dev servers becoming unstable during staging deployment
• Solution: Enhanced all Firebase deployment scripts with safety measures
• Files: tools/deploy-firebase-*.sh (all 3 scripts)
• Impact: Eliminates deployment conflicts, protects development environment

🎪 Enhanced Room Switcher (Always-Visible Room Display)
• Problem: Fresh users saw no room identification in header
• Solution: Modified component to always show current room
• Files: src/components/ChatRoomSwitcher.tsx
• Impact: Immediate room context for all users

🔧 React Hydration Mismatch Fix
• Problem: CompactGlobalNotificationBanner causing hydration mismatches
• Solution: Implemented standard React SSR pattern with isClient state
• Files: src/components/CompactGlobalNotificationBanner.tsx
• Impact: No more hydration errors, smooth loading experience

🔧 Dynamic Import Error Prevention
• Problem: TypeError when entering rooms due to undefined roomId
• Solution: Enhanced parameter safety with comprehensive guards
• Files: src/app/chat/[roomId]/page.tsx
• Impact: Eliminated undefined errors during navigation

📚 Comprehensive Documentation Updates
• New: docs/DEVELOPMENT-STABILITY-UX-UPDATE-JUNE-11-2025.md
• Updated: docs/06-DEPLOYMENT.md, docs/11-TROUBLESHOOTING.md, README.md
• Content: Technical implementation details, testing procedures

🚀 DEPLOYMENT IMPACT
• Developer Experience: Eliminated deployment conflicts
• User Experience: Improved room identification for newcomers
• System Stability: Prevented hydration mismatches and import errors
• Workflow Preservation: No breaking changes, enhanced safety
