🎯💻✅ PRODUCTION: Messaging Fix Success + Staging Servers Deployed

Production messaging issue resolved with fixed WebSocket servers deployed to all environments.

🎯 CRITICAL: Production Messaging Issue RESOLVED
• Problem: Messages didn't appear on sender's device in production (worked in dev)
• Root Cause: socket.to() vs io.to() broadcasting difference between environments
• Solution: Created signaling-server-production-FIXED.js with correct io.to(roomId) logic
• Files: signaling-server-production-FIXED.js, Dockerfile.minimal
• Status: ✅ PRODUCTION NOW WORKING PERFECTLY

🚀 STAGING SERVERS DEPLOYED (Ready for Testing)
• Updated deploy-websocket-environments.sh to use working Dockerfile.minimal
• Deployed fixed servers to all environments: preview, staging, production
• Preview Server: wss://peddlenet-websocket-server-preview-*.run.app (📝 needs testing)
• Staging Server: wss://peddlenet-websocket-server-staging-*.run.app (📝 needs testing)
• Production Server: wss://peddlenet-websocket-server-production-*.run.app (✅ verified working)

🔧 INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS
• Fixed build failures by using minimal dependencies (no SQLite compilation issues)
• Enhanced deployment script to use proven working configuration
• Added dynamic = 'force-dynamic' to diagnostic pages preventing static generation errors
• Streamlined Docker builds with Dockerfile.minimal approach

📚 COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION
• Updated: docs/ENVIRONMENT-SYNC-ISSUE-TRACKING.md (production success + staging deployment status)
• Updated: docs/PRODUCTION-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md (working configuration documented)
• Updated: docs/MESSAGING-TROUBLESHOOTING-GUIDE.md (debugging reference)
• Updated: README.md (production messaging fix success)

🎆 CURRENT STATUS
• ✅ Production: Working perfectly - sender sees own messages immediately
• ✅ Dev: Working perfectly (unchanged)
• 🔄 Staging/Preview: Servers deployed with fix, ready for testing
• Next step: Test staging environments to confirm messaging fix

📝 NEXT STEPS FOR COMPLETE RESOLUTION
• Test staging: npm run deploy:firebase:complete
• Test preview: ./scripts/deploy-preview-simple.sh test-messaging
• Verify messaging works in staging/preview environments
• Document complete success once all environments confirmed working
