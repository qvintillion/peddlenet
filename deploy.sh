✅ Server rate limit increased from 5 to 15 attempts/minute (300% more tolerant)
✅ Throttle duration reduced from 30s to 10s (67% faster recovery)
✅ Circuit breaker threshold increased from 3 to 5 failures (67% more tolerant)
✅ Recovery timeout reduced from 30s to 15s (50% faster recovery)
✅ Exponential backoff optimized: gentler curve, max 8s vs 30s (75% faster)
