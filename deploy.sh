🎉 Universal Server Architecture Complete + Documentation Updated

Completed the universal server architecture implementation with comprehensive documentation updates, creating a unified system that automatically adapts to any environment.

🧡 UNIVERSAL SERVER COMPLETED
• Single file: signaling-server.js for all environments (dev/staging/production)
• Auto-detection: NODE_ENV + PLATFORM based environment switching
• Smart configuration: Adapts CORS, logging, endpoints per environment
• Future-ready: Analytics and mesh network endpoints built-in
• Clean deployment: All scripts reference the universal server

🔧 INFRASTRUCTURE CLEANUP
• Removed redundant server files (archived safely)
• Updated all deployment scripts and Dockerfiles
• Fixed package.json scripts to use universal server
• Updated cloudbuild configs for universal architecture
• Eliminated quote escaping issues in staging deployment

📚 DOCUMENTATION OVERHAUL
• Architecture.md: Updated to reflect universal server approach
• Deployment.md: Comprehensive universal server deployment guide
• README.md: Complete universal server benefits and workflow
• SIMPLE_WORKFLOW_SUMMARY.md: Universal server workflow documentation
• All docs now explain the one-server approach

🚀 DEPLOYMENT READY
• All environments tested and working with universal server
• Production notifications fixed and validated
• Staging deployment script syntax errors resolved
• Complete deployment workflow validated
• Health endpoints provide rich environment information

🎯 BENEFITS ACHIEVED
• One server file eliminates confusion
• Automatic environment adaptation
• Future features foundation ready
• Enhanced development experience
• Production optimization built-in
• Clean, maintainable codebase

Result: Revolutionary universal server architecture that automatically adapts to any environment - the future of deployment simplicity!
