🔔🔧🔍 CRITICAL: Notification Toggle Fixes + Reconnection Loop Prevention

Major notification system fixes resolving unresponsive toggles and infinite reconnection loops.

🔔 CRITICAL: Global Notification Toggle Fixes
• Problem: Master notifications and message alerts toggles unresponsive in global banner
• Root Cause: Event propagation conflicts between nested clickable elements
• Solution: Removed conflicting <label>/<input>, added explicit preventDefault/stopPropagation
• Files: src/components/CompactGlobalNotificationBanner.tsx
• Impact: Toggles now work immediately with instant visual feedback

🔧 CRITICAL: Background Notifications Reconnection Loop Fixed
• Problem: Infinite reconnection attempts when users unsubscribed from all rooms
• Root Cause: Missing flag to distinguish user-initiated vs accidental disconnection
• Solution: Added isUserDisconnected tracking with smart connection logic
• Files: src/hooks/use-background-notifications.ts
• Impact: Eliminates resource waste and server overload from unwanted connections

🔍 Enhanced Settings Update Mechanism
• Problem: Settings changes not propagating immediately to all components
• Solution: Enhanced updateSettings with immediate local state updates and debugging
• Files: src/hooks/use-push-notifications.ts
• Impact: Reliable cross-component synchronization and persistence

💡 Dropdown Event Propagation Fix
• Problem: Clicking toggles inside dropdown closed the dropdown
• Solution: Added stopPropagation to dropdown container and toggle handlers
• Files: src/components/CompactGlobalNotificationBanner.tsx
• Impact: Users can adjust settings without dropdown closing unexpectedly

📚 Comprehensive Documentation Updates
• New: docs/NOTIFICATION-FIXES-JUNE-11-2025.md (detailed technical implementation)
• Updated: docs/11-TROUBLESHOOTING.md (notification troubleshooting section)
• Content: Testing procedures, debugging steps, user verification guides

🚀 USER EXPERIENCE IMPACT
• Predictable Controls: Notification toggles work immediately when clicked
• Persistent Settings: Preferences save and restore properly across sessions
• No More Loops: Smooth room navigation without connection spam
• Resource Efficiency: Background connections only when actually needed
• Enhanced Debugging: Console logs help track notification state changes
