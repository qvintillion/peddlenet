• Smart dropdown headers adapt to user context ("Room Options" vs "Switch Room")
• Seamless room discovery from any chat room without Home page navigation
• Enhanced click detection prevents event conflicts with backdrop
• Clean interface with removed arrow for professional appearance

🔄 SERVER CONNECTION RELIABILITY
• Enhanced WebSocket connection resilience
• Improved automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
• Better session recovery after network interruptions
• Connection health monitoring every 30 seconds
• Graceful degradation during server offline periods
• Optimized connection pooling for concurrent users

🔔 BACKGROUND NOTIFICATION OPTIMIZATION  
• Smart notification throttling to prevent spam
• Enhanced visibility detection using multiple browser APIs
• Cross-room notification management for multi-room users
• iOS Safari and Android Chrome compatibility improvements
• PWA notification integration for app-like experience

🛡️ CORS DEBUGGING & RESOLUTION
• Comprehensive CORS configuration for production
• Enhanced development CORS with localhost support
• Dynamic origin detection for dev environments
• Mobile device testing with IP address access
• Debug tools for CORS header inspection
• Improved error reporting for CORS failures

⚡ DEV ENVIRONMENT WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION
• Enhanced mobile development workflow (npm run dev:mobile)
• Automatic port conflict detection and resolution
• Environment variable validation before dev server start
• Hot reload optimization for faster development cycles
• Enhanced debugging tools and diagnostics panels
• Mobile-specific debugging with device information

🔧 TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS
• Component memoization for better React performance
• Lazy loading for non-critical components
• Bundle size optimization with dynamic imports
• Memory leak prevention in WebSocket connections
• Enhanced input validation and XSS prevention
• Rate limiting for API calls and message sending
