echo "✅ CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED:"
echo "========================="
echo "✅ Production WebSocket script now uses cloudbuild-minimal.yaml (aligned with staging)"
echo "✅ Both staging and production use same Docker configuration"
echo "✅ Environment variables standardized across all scripts"
echo "✅ Service naming consistency verified"
echo "✅ Wrong script references corrected"
echo ""

echo "📋 SCRIPT ALIGNMENT VERIFICATION:"
echo "================================="

echo "🎭 STAGING SCRIPTS:"
echo "   ✅ deploy-websocket-staging.sh → cloudbuild-minimal.yaml"
echo "   ✅ deploy-vercel-staging-complete.sh → Comprehensive workflow"
echo "   ✅ Service: peddlenet-websocket-server-staging"
echo "   ✅ Environment: staging, NODE_ENV=production"

echo "🎪 PRODUCTION SCRIPTS:"
echo "   ✅ deploy-websocket-cloudbuild.sh → cloudbuild-minimal.yaml (FIXED)"
echo "   ✅ deploy-vercel-production-enhanced.sh → Comprehensive workflow"  
echo "   ✅ Service: peddlenet-websocket-server"
echo "   ✅ Environment: production, NODE_ENV=production"

echo "🔧 ENVIRONMENT CONSISTENCY:"
echo "==========================="
echo "   ✅ Both use Dockerfile.minimal"
echo "   ✅ Both use signaling-server.js (universal)"
echo "   ✅ Both set proper environment variables"
