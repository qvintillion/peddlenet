## 🚨 CRITICAL FIX: Messages from Same Device Not Appearing

**Issue**: Messages sent from a device were not appearing in the chat for that same device
**Root Cause**: **Missing `chat-message` handler in the WebSocket server!**

### 🔧 What Was Broken

The WebSocket server (`signaling-server.js`) was missing the critical `chat-message` event handler. When a user sent a message:

1. ✅ Frontend sends message via `socket.emit('chat-message', payload)`
2. ❌ **Server had no handler for `chat-message` events**
3. ❌ Message was lost - never broadcasted back to room participants
4. ❌ User sees empty chat, even their own messages don't appear

### ✅ What Was Fixed

**Added missing `chat-message` handler** to the WebSocket server:

```javascript
// CRITICAL: Handle chat messages (was missing!)
socket.on('chat-message', ({ roomId, message }) => {
  if (!socket.userData || socket.userData.roomId !== roomId) {
    console.warn(`❌ Unauthorized message attempt from ${socket.id} to room ${roomId}`);
    return;
  }

  const { displayName } = socket.userData;
  
  const fullMessage = {
    id: message.id || Date.now().toString(),
    content: message.content,
    sender: displayName,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    type: 'chat',
    roomId,
    synced: true
  };

  console.log(`💬 Message from ${displayName} in ${roomId}: ${message.content}`);
  
  // Broadcast to ALL users in the room (including sender)
  io.to(roomId).emit('chat-message', fullMessage);
});
```

**Also added health check support**:
```javascript
// Health check ping/pong
socket.on('health-ping', (data) => {
  socket.emit('health-pong', { timestamp: Date.now(), received: data.timestamp });
});
```

### 🎯 Why This Happened

The room code fixes I made earlier were **completely unrelated** to this messaging issue. This was a **pre-existing problem** where the WebSocket server simply never had the `chat-message` handler implemented properly.

### ✅ Expected Results After Fix

1. **Messages appear instantly** for the sender
2. **Messages broadcast to all room participants** 
3. **Real-time chat works properly** across all devices
4. **Health monitoring works** (ping/pong)

### 🧪 Test the Fix

1. **Restart the server**: `npm run dev:mobile`
2. **Join a room**: http://localhost:3000/chat/test-room
3. **Send a message**: Your own messages should now appear immediately
4. **Multi-device test**: Messages should appear on all connected devices

The messaging should now work perfectly! 🎉
