## 🔗 Sharing & Inviting

### **Room Code Sharing (Primary Method)**

**Room codes are the easiest way to invite people:**
- **Format**: Two words + number (e.g., "bright-stage-42")
- **Sharing**: Tell someone "Join bright-stage-42" verbally or via text
- **Case Insensitive**: "BRIGHT-STAGE-42" works same as "bright-stage-42"
- **Memorable**: Designed to be easy to remember and share

**Best Practices:**
```markdown
✅ DO: "Join bright-stage-42 on Festival Chat"
✅ DO: Text the room code in group messages
✅ DO: Write room code on whiteboards/signs
❌ DON'T: Share entire URLs (too long and complex)
```

### **QR Code Sharing (Visual Method)**

**QR codes are perfect for visual sharing:**
- **Display**: Project on screens, show on phone, print on signs
- **Scanning**: Point any camera at QR code to join instantly
- **No Typing**: Eliminates mistakes from manual room code entry
- **Fast**: Fastest way to get multiple people connected

**Best Use Cases:**
```markdown
✅ Conference presentations (project QR on screen)
✅ Event entrances (print QR on signs)
✅ Group meetups (show QR on phone screen)
✅ Stage announcements ("Scan to join backstage chat")
```
