3. **Keep the app open** - Connections drop if you switch apps
4. **Rejoin if disconnected** - Just scan the QR code again

### Troubleshooting

- Make sure you're in the same room (exact room ID)
- Check that you're on HTTPS (not HTTP)
- Try manual connection with Peer IDs
- Refresh the page and try again

**"Messages aren't sending"**
