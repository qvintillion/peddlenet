# 🔧 Emergency P2P Stability Fix

## Quick Test: Disable Auto-Reconnect

The peer recreation is likely caused by the auto-reconnect system fighting with initialization. Let's disable it temporarily.

### **Option 1: Use Test Page**
Visit: `https://your-ngrok.io/test-room`

This uses the simplified P2P hook without auto-reconnect loops.

### **Option 2: Quick Fix Current Page**

In browser console, run this to disable auto-reconnect:
```javascript
// Disable the auto-reconnect interval
clearInterval = (() => {
  const original = clearInterval;
  return function(id) {
    console.log('🛑 Blocking interval:', id);
    return original(id);
  };
})();

// Reload to start fresh
location.reload();
```

### **Option 3: Manual Connection Test**

1. **Desktop**: 
   - Wait for peer to stabilize (watch console)
   - Copy the FINAL peer ID (after recreations stop)
   - Don't generate QR yet

2. **Mobile**:
   - Open same room
   - Use "Manual Connect" 
   - Paste the FINAL peer ID from desktop

### **What We're Testing:**

- ✅ **If manual connection works**: Problem is QR timing/auto-reconnect
- ❌ **If peer keeps recreating on test page**: Deeper React/network issue
- ❌ **If mobile can't even load test page**: Mobile HTTPS/network issue

## Expected Test Page Behavior:

**Good (stable):**
```
🚀 Trying PeerJS config 1: default
✅ P2P ready with peer ID: abc123...
[No more peer recreations]
```

**Bad (still unstable):**
```
🚀 Trying PeerJS config 1: default  
✅ P2P ready with peer ID: abc123...
🔒 Peer closed
✅ P2P ready with peer ID: def456...  [Recreation = BAD]
```

Try the test page first - if that's stable, we know the issue is in the complex auto-reconnect logic!
