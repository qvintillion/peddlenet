   - Updated commit description to emphasize stable unified infrastructure
   - Streamlined deployment messaging for ongoing feature work
   - Maintained all infrastructure status reporting

2. **Created Helper Script** - `scripts/update-deploy-message.sh`
   - 11 predefined deployment type templates
   - Quick customization without editing main script
   - Consistent infrastructure status inclusion
