# Deploy Log - FINAL FIX: Prevent Ghost Reconnections

## 🎯 **Root Cause IDENTIFIED & FIXED**

**The Real Problem**: When pressing home button on mobile:
1. ✅ Mobile correctly disconnects (`👋 User left: q`)
2. ❌ **BUT then auto-reconnects while still on home screen** (`👋 User joined: q (new)`)
3. ❌ System thinks user is "actively present" → no notifications sent

**The Issue**: Auto-reconnect logic was too aggressive and didn't respect background state.

## 🛠️ **Comprehensive Solution**

### 1. **Centralized Background State Management**
Created `use-background-state.ts` that tracks:
- `pageHide` events (home button pressed)
- `visibilitychange` events (app backgrounded)
- `pageShow` events (user returns)
- Persistent state across disconnect/reconnect cycles

### 2. **Prevent Auto-Reconnection When Backgrounded**
Enhanced WebSocket connection logic:
```typescript
// **KEY FIX**: Don't auto-reconnect if app is backgrounded
if (isCurrentlyBackgrounded || backgroundState.isBackgrounded || backgroundState.wasRecentlyBackgrounded) {
  console.log('📱 App is backgrounded - SKIPPING auto-reconnect');
  console.log('   This prevents ghost connections while on home screen');
  setShouldAutoReconnect(false); // Disable auto-reconnect
  return; // Exit early, no reconnection attempt
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced Notification Logic**
Uses persistent background state for notification decisions:
```typescript
// Show notifications if user was recently backgrounded
if (isDefinitelyBackground || !hasFocus || isRecentlyBackgrounded || typeof document === 'undefined') {
  return true; // Show notification
}
```

## 🔄 **Expected Flow After Fix**

**Before (Broken)**:
1. Press home → disconnect → **auto-reconnect while on home** → no notifications

**After (Fixed)**:
1. Press home → `📱 Page hidden (home button?) at: [time]`
2. Disconnect → `📱 App is backgrounded - SKIPPING auto-reconnect`
3. **Stay disconnected while on home screen** ← KEY FIX
4. Desktop sends message → Mobile gets notification (because user is truly absent)
5. Return to app → `📱 Page shown - user returned to app` → reconnect

## 🧪 **Testing Process**

1. **Mobile (q)**: Join chat
2. **Mobile (q)**: Press home button
3. **Check logs**: Should see `SKIPPING auto-reconnect`
4. **Verify**: "q" should stay absent from peer list (no ghost rejoining)
5. **Desktop (1)**: Send message
6. **Mobile (q)**: Should receive notification
7. **Return to app**: Should reconnect properly

## 📋 **Debug Logs to Watch For**

**Success indicators**:
```
📱 Page hidden (home button?) at: [time]
📱 Background check on disconnect: {wasRecentlyBackgrounded: true, ...}
📱 App is backgrounded - SKIPPING auto-reconnect
   This prevents ghost connections while on home screen
```

**Notification should trigger**:
```
📱 Mobile visibility check: {isRecentlyBackgrounded: true, ...}
📱 Mobile: showing notification {reason: 'recently backgrounded', ...}
```

## 🔧 **Architecture Improvements**

- **Shared state**: Background state shared between notification and connection logic
- **Event-driven**: Proper `pagehide`/`pageshow` event handling
- **Persistent**: State survives page reloads and connection cycles
- **Defensive**: Multiple fallback indicators for background detection

---
**Deploy Command**: `npm run deploy:firebase:quick`
**Risk Level**: Medium (significant logic changes, but well-tested patterns)
**Expected Result**: No more ghost reconnections, mobile notifications work properly
**Rollback**: Revert 3 files: `use-background-state.ts`, `use-websocket-chat.ts`, `use-push-notifications.ts`
