# Deploy Log - Notification Fix & Better Logging

## Changes Made (June 10, 2025)

### üîî Fixed Home‚ÜíNot Getting Notifications Issue

**Problem**: Users weren't receiving notifications when they pressed the home button on mobile devices because the app still appeared "focused" to the browser.

**Solution**: Enhanced mobile-first notification logic in `use-push-notifications.ts`:

- **Mobile devices**: More aggressive notification triggering that checks multiple indicators
- **Enhanced detection**: Uses `document.hidden`, `document.visibilityState`, and `document.hasFocus()` 
- **Safety fallback**: Assumes backgrounded state when unable to determine status
- **Desktop preservation**: Maintains existing desktop behavior for better UX

**Code changes**:
```typescript
// New mobile-first logic
if (isMobile) {
  const isDefinitelyBackground = document.hidden || document.visibilityState === 'hidden';
  const hasFocus = document.hasFocus();
  
  // Show notifications if backgrounded OR no focus OR can't determine
  if (isDefinitelyBackground || !hasFocus || typeof document === 'undefined') {
    return true; // Show notification
  }
}
```

### üìù Improved Peer Detection Logging

**Context**: The "wonky peer detection" was actually correct behavior - User_457 joining/leaving was just someone (you) opening the chat without a display name and leaving quickly.

**Enhancement**: Better logging to distinguish between anonymous and named users in `use-websocket-chat.ts`:

- **Clearer logging**: Separates anonymous (User_XXX) from named users
- **Context indicators**: Shows when anonymous users are likely just setting proper names
- **Better diagnostics**: Easier to understand what's happening in the logs

**Code changes**:
```typescript
// Enhanced logging for anonymous vs named users
const isAnonymous = peer.displayName.startsWith('User_');
const logMessage = isAnonymous 
  ? `üìù Anonymous user joined: ${peer.displayName} (temporary connection)`
  : `üëã User joined: ${peer.displayName}`;

console.log('Enhanced peers:', {
  total: uniquePeerNames.length,
  named: namedUsers.length,
  anonymous: anonymousUsers.length,
  namedUsers,
  anonymousUsers
});
```

## Testing Instructions

### For Notification Fix:
1. Open app on mobile device
2. Join a chat room
3. Press home button (don't close app)
4. Have someone else send a message
5. **Expected**: Notification should appear
6. **Previous behavior**: No notification would show

### For Logging Improvement:
1. Open chat room and check console
2. **Expected**: Clearer distinction between named users and anonymous temporary connections
3. **Previous behavior**: All joins/leaves looked the same

## Deploy Commands

```bash
# Quick staging deploy (recommended for testing)
npm run deploy:firebase:quick

# Super quick (if only frontend changes)
npm run deploy:firebase:super-quick

# Complete deploy (if backend changes needed)
npm run deploy:firebase:complete
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Revert the two modified files:
   - `src/hooks/use-push-notifications.ts`
   - `src/hooks/use-websocket-chat.ts`
2. Run `npm run deploy:firebase:quick`

## Next Steps

1. **Test notification fix on staging**
2. **Verify logging is clearer in console**
3. **Deploy to production if stable**

---
**Deploy Status**: Ready for staging
**Risk Level**: Very Low (focused notification fix + logging improvement)
**Rollback Time**: ~5 minutes
**Primary Fix**: Mobile notification issue (the main problem)
**Secondary**: Better logging to understand peer activity
