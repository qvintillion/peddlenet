# Environment Isolation Fix - June 2025

## 🚨 Problem Identified
Staging and preview deployments were connecting to production servers due to environment variable contamination and missing staging deployment script.

## 🔧 Root Causes Fixed

### 1. **Missing Staging Deployment Script**
- **Problem**: Only had preview deployment, no dedicated staging deployment
- **Solution**: Created `scripts/deploy-staging-simple.sh`

### 2. **Environment Variable Contamination**
- **Problem**: `.env.local` was contaminated with preview environment variables
- **Solution**: 
  - Reset `.env.local` to local development settings
  - Improved deployment scripts with proper backup/restore
  - Added environment isolation

### 3. **Poor Environment Detection**
- **Problem**: Hard to debug which environment was being used
- **Solution**: Enhanced `server-utils.ts` with better logging and environment detection

## 📋 New Commands Available

```bash
# Local Development (unchanged)
npm run dev:mobile

# Preview Deployment (improved)
npm run preview:deploy [channel-name]

# NEW: Staging Deployment  
npm run staging:deploy

# NEW: Environment Verification
npm run env:verify

# Production (unchanged)
npm run deploy:firebase:complete
```

## 🔍 How It Works Now

### **Local Development** (`.env.local`)
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SIGNALING_SERVER=http://localhost:3001
BUILD_TARGET=development
```

### **Preview Deployment** (`.env.preview`)
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SIGNALING_SERVER=wss://peddlenet-websocket-server-preview-433318323150.us-central1.run.app
BUILD_TARGET=preview
```

### **Staging Deployment** (`.env.staging`)
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SIGNALING_SERVER=wss://peddlenet-websocket-server-staging-433318323150.us-central1.run.app
BUILD_TARGET=staging
```

## 🛡️ Environment Isolation Process

1. **Backup Current Environment**: Scripts backup `.env.local` before deployment
2. **Copy Target Environment**: Copy `.env.staging` or `.env.preview` to `.env.local`
3. **Build with Correct Environment**: Next.js builds with the correct environment variables
4. **Deploy**: Firebase deployment uses the correct environment
5. **Restore Original Environment**: Scripts restore original `.env.local`

## 🧪 Testing Commands

```bash
# Verify environment setup
npm run env:verify

# Test staging deployment
npm run staging:deploy

# Test preview deployment  
npm run preview:deploy test-fix

# Check browser console for environment detection logs
# Look for: "🎭 DETECTED: Staging environment" or "🔮 DETECTED: Preview environment"
```

## 🚀 What's Fixed

✅ **Staging deployment now connects to staging WebSocket server**  
✅ **Preview deployment now connects to preview WebSocket server**  
✅ **Local development unaffected**  
✅ **Environment contamination prevented**  
✅ **Better debugging and environment detection**  
✅ **Proper backup/restore of environment files**  

## 🔍 Verification

After deployment, check browser console for:
- `🎭 DETECTED: Staging environment` (for staging)
- `🔮 DETECTED: Preview environment` (for preview)
- WebSocket server URL should match the target environment

The staging/preview environments should now connect to their respective WebSocket servers instead of production!
