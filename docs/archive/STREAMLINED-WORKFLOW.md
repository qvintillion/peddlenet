## 🔄 **Recommended Development Cycle**

### **Daily Feature Development:**
```bash
# 1. Local development and testing
npm run dev:mobile
# → Make changes, test locally on desktop + mobile

# 2. Preview deployment for validation
npm run preview:deploy feature-name
# → Test in production-like environment
# → Share with stakeholders if needed
# → Verify mobile functionality

# 3. Production deployment when ready
git add . && git commit -m "feature: description"
git push origin main
./deploy.sh
# → Live for users
```

### **Quick Iteration Cycle:**
```bash
# For rapid testing during development:
npm run dev:mobile                    # Local testing
npm run preview:deploy quick-test     # Quick staging validation
npm run deploy:firebase:super-quick   # Fast staging updates
```
