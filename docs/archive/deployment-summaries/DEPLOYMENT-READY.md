./deploy.sh
```

## ‚úÖ Deployment Checklist

- [x] **Critical bug identified and fixed** - Background notifications causing infinite loops
- [x] **Smart connection management implemented** - Only connects when needed
- [x] **Rate limiting added** - Exponential backoff prevents server overload  
- [x] **Documentation updated** - README, troubleshooting, and deployment guides
- [x] **Deploy script prepared** - Ready for GitHub production deployment
- [x] **Zero backend changes** - Safe frontend-only deployment
- [x] **Testing validated** - Fix confirmed working in development

## üéØ Expected Outcomes

### **Before Fix (Problems)**
- Infinite reconnection loops when notifications disabled but room favorited
- "Connection rate limit exceeded" errors causing app instability
- Unnecessary background connections draining mobile battery
- Server overload from rapid connection attempts

### **After Fix (Solutions)**  
- ‚úÖ No connection attempts when notifications disabled
- ‚úÖ Exponential backoff prevents rate limiting
- ‚úÖ Enhanced mobile battery life from reduced network activity
- ‚úÖ Improved server efficiency with smart connection management
- ‚úÖ Better error handling with specific rate limit detection

## üìä Technical Implementation

### **Smart Connection Management**
```typescript
// Only connect when notifications actually enabled
if (hasActiveSubscriptions) {
  this.connect();
} else {
  console.log('No active subscriptions - skipping connection');
}
```

### **Rate Limiting & Backoff**
```typescript
// Exponential backoff: 2s ‚Üí 4s ‚Üí 8s ‚Üí 16s ‚Üí 30s max
const delay = Math.min(this.baseDelay * Math.pow(2, attempts), this.maxDelay);
```

### **Connection State Validation**
```typescript
// Prevent unnecessary connections
private shouldAttemptConnection(): boolean {
  return !this.isConnecting && 
         !this.socket?.connected && 
         this.hasActiveSubscriptions() &&
         !this.isRateLimited();
}
```

## üîç Validation Steps

### **Post-Deployment Testing**
1. **Add room to favorites**
2. **Disable notifications for that room**
3. **Enter the room**
4. **Verify**: Console shows "No active subscriptions - skipping connection"
5. **Verify**: No "Connection rate limit exceeded" errors
6. **Re-enable notifications**
7. **Verify**: Connection establishes successfully

### **Performance Monitoring**
- Check browser console for connection attempts
- Monitor network tab for excessive requests
- Verify mobile battery usage improvement
- Test notification functionality when enabled
