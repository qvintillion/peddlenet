# TEMP FILES - Can be deleted after successful deployment
# These were created during debugging and are no longer needed:
# - Dockerfile.test
# - Dockerfile.simple  
# - package-websocket.json
# - deployment/cloudbuild-test.yaml
# - deployment/cloudbuild-debug.yaml
# - scripts/debug-build.sh
# - scripts/get-build-logs.sh
