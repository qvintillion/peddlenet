# üîß FIXED: Infinite Reconnection Loop Issue (June 2025)

## üéØ **Summary**

**Issue**: Users experienced infinite reconnection loops when removing a room from favorites and then re-entering the room, causing excessive server connections and poor user experience.

**Root Cause**: Race condition between background notifications manager and WebSocket chat hook trying to connect to the same server simultaneously.

**Solution**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Added conflict detection and avoidance mechanism to prevent simultaneous connections.

---

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

### **The Problem Flow:**
1. **User removes room from favorites** ‚Üí Calls `unsubscribeFromRoom(roomId)` in background notifications manager
2. **Background notification manager** ‚Üí Disconnects background socket since no active subscriptions remain
3. **User clicks on recent room** ‚Üí Navigates to `/chat/[roomId]`
4. **Chat page loads** ‚Üí `useRoomBackgroundNotifications` hook runs and checks existing subscription
5. **Subscription check finds** ‚Üí Room exists but with `subscribed: false`
6. **Hook skips auto-subscribe** ‚Üí Due to explicit user preference to disable notifications
7. **Background manager tries to connect anyway** ‚Üí But finds no active subscriptions, immediately disconnects
8. **WebSocket chat hook** ‚Üí Attempts its own connection to same server
9. **Multiple connection managers** ‚Üí Fighting over the same server URL causing connection conflicts
10. **Infinite loop** ‚Üí Background manager and WebSocket chat hook keep interfering with each other

### **Key Issues Identified:**

**1. Race Condition Between Connection Managers**
```typescript
// Background notifications manager (singleton)
// + WebSocket chat hook (per room)
// = Two different connection managers trying to connect to same server
```

**2. Subscription State Inconsistency**
```typescript
// In useRoomBackgroundNotifications:
if (!existingSubscription || existingSubscription.subscribed) {
  // Auto-subscribes
} else {
  console.log('üîï Skipping auto-subscription - notifications disabled');
  // BUT background manager still tries to connect anyway
}
```

**3. Circuit Breaker Conflicts**
Both the background notifications manager and WebSocket chat hook have their own circuit breakers and retry logic, which can conflict.

---

## üîß **The Fix**

### **1. Conflict Detection Mechanism**

Added a method to detect active WebSocket chat connections before the background notifications manager attempts to connect:

```typescript
// CRITICAL FIX: Detect active WebSocket chat connections to prevent conflicts
private isActiveWebSocketChatConnected(): boolean {
  try {
    // Check for active socket.io connections from the chat hook
    const globalSocketIO = (window as any).io;
    if (globalSocketIO && globalSocketIO.managers) {
      for (const [url, manager] of Object.entries(globalSocketIO.managers as any)) {
        if (manager && manager.engine && manager.engine.readyState === 'open') {
          console.log('üîç Detected active WebSocket manager:', url);
          return true;
        }
      }
    }
    
    // Check for DOM elements indicating active chat
    const chatContainer = document.querySelector('[data-chat-active="true"]');
    if (chatContainer) {
      console.log('üîç Detected active chat container');
      return true;
    }
    
    return false;
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('Error checking for active WebSocket connections:', error);
    return false;
  }
}
```

### **2. Conflict Avoidance Strategy**

Modified the background notifications manager's connect method to check for conflicts:

```typescript
private connect() {
  if (!this.shouldAttemptConnection()) {
    return;
  }

  // CRITICAL FIX: Check for active chat connections to prevent conflicts
  if (this.isActiveWebSocketChatConnected()) {
    console.log('üö´ Active WebSocket chat connection detected - deferring background notifications');
    this.scheduleConflictAvoidanceReconnection();
    return;
  }

  // ... rest of connection logic
}
```

### **3. Extended Conflict Avoidance Delays**

Added a special reconnection schedule for conflict situations:

```typescript
// CRITICAL FIX: Schedule reconnection with conflict avoidance
private scheduleConflictAvoidanceReconnection() {
  // Clear any existing timer
  if (this.reconnectTimer) {
    clearTimeout(this.reconnectTimer);
    this.reconnectTimer = null;
  }

  // Wait longer when avoiding conflicts (30 seconds)
  const conflictAvoidanceDelay = 30000;
  console.log(`üîî Scheduling conflict-avoidance reconnection in ${conflictAvoidanceDelay/1000}s`);
  
  this.reconnectTimer = setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('üîî Attempting conflict-avoidance background notification reconnection...');
    this.connect();
  }, conflictAvoidanceDelay);
}
```

### **4. Chat Page Detection Enhancement**

Added a data attribute to the chat page container to help background manager detect active chats:

```typescript
<div 
  className="..."
  data-chat-active={roomId && displayName ? "true" : "false"}
>
```

## üß™ **Testing the Fix**

### **Test Scenario 1: Basic Infinite Loop Prevention**
1. **Add room to favorites** ‚Üí Navigate to room, add to favorites
2. **Remove from favorites** ‚Üí Remove room from favorites (triggers unsubscribe)
3. **Navigate back to room** ‚Üí Click on recent room to re-enter
4. **Expected behavior**: ‚úÖ No infinite reconnection loop
5. **Debug logs**: Should show "Active WebSocket chat connection detected - deferring background notifications"

### **Test Scenario 2: Multiple Tab Conflict Avoidance**
1. **Open same room in two tabs** ‚Üí Both tabs try to establish connections
2. **Expected behavior**: ‚úÖ Background notifications defer to active chat tab
3. **Debug logs**: Should show conflict detection working

### **Test Scenario 3: Background Notifications Still Work**
1. **Navigate away from room** ‚Üí Go to homepage or another room
2. **Send message from another device** ‚Üí Message should arrive in background
3. **Expected behavior**: ‚úÖ Background notifications still trigger when no active chat
4. **Debug logs**: Should show normal background notification flow

### **Console Debug Commands**

```javascript
// Check background notification manager state
console.log(window.backgroundNotificationManager?.getState());

// Check for active WebSocket connections manually  
window.io?.managers; // Should show active connections

// Check chat container detection
document.querySelector('[data-chat-active="true"]'); // Should exist when in chat
```

## üìã **Files Modified**

### **1. Background Notifications Manager**
**File**: `src/hooks/use-background-notifications.ts`

**Changes**:
- Added `isActiveWebSocketChatConnected()` method for conflict detection
- Added `scheduleConflictAvoidanceReconnection()` for extended delays
- Modified `connect()` method to check for conflicts before connecting

### **2. Chat Page Container**
**File**: `src/app/chat/[roomId]/page.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added `data-chat-active` attribute to main container
- Enables DOM-based detection of active chat sessions

---

## üéØ **Expected Behavior After Fix**

### **‚úÖ Fixed: Infinite Reconnection Loop**
- Background notifications manager detects active chat connections
- Defers its own connection attempts when chat is active
- Uses longer delays (30s) to avoid interference

### **‚úÖ Maintained: Background Notifications**
- Still work when user navigates away from chat
- Still work when no active chat connection exists
- User preferences for notifications are preserved

### **‚úÖ Improved: Resource Usage**
- Eliminates unnecessary duplicate connections
- Reduces server load from reconnection loops
- Improves battery life on mobile devices

### **‚úÖ Enhanced: Debug Information**
- Clear console logs showing conflict detection
- Easy to diagnose connection manager behavior
- Better visibility into background notification state

---

## üö® **Important Notes**

### **Graceful Degradation**
- If conflict detection fails, system falls back to normal behavior
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Error handling prevents crashes from detection failures

### **Performance Impact**
- Minimal: Detection runs only during connection attempts
- No continuous polling or monitoring
- Very lightweight DOM and global object checks

### **Browser Compatibility**
- Works with all modern browsers
- Gracefully handles cases where global objects don't exist
- Falls back safely in server-side rendering environments
