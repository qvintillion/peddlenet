- **Backend**: Cloud Run staging instance
- **WebSocket**: Staging signaling server
- **Domain**: `*.web.app` or `*.firebaseapp.com`

### **Post-Deployment Verification**:
1. Check staging server logs for P2P initialization
2. Verify admin analytics dashboard loads
3. Confirm WebSocket server shows P2P capabilities
4. Test basic room creation and joining

## 🧪 Staging Test Plan

### **Test Scenario 1: Basic P2P Auto-Upgrade** 🎯
**Objective**: Verify automatic P2P upgrade triggers correctly

**Steps**:
1. Open staging URL in **two different browsers/devices**
2. Join same room with different usernames (e.g., "tester1", "tester2")
3. **Watch browser console logs** for:
   ```
   🚀 [INSTANT P2P] WebRTC offer detected from: [socketId]
   🎯 [INSTANT P2P] Auto-upgrading due to WebRTC signaling activity
   🌐 [P2P UPGRADE] Attempting P2P upgrade...
   ✅ Data channel opened to [username]
   ```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Auto-upgrade triggers within **3 seconds** of second user joining
- [ ] P2P connection establishes successfully
- [ ] No "unknown peer" warnings
- [ ] Both users show as connected

### **Test Scenario 2: P2P Messaging** 📱
**Objective**: Verify messages transmit via P2P connection

**Steps**:
1. After P2P connection established (from Test 1)
2. Send messages from both users
3. Check console logs for P2P message routing
4. Verify messages appear in real-time

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Messages appear instantly (< 1 second delay)
- [ ] Console shows P2P message routing
- [ ] No message loss or duplication
- [ ] Fallback to WebSocket if P2P fails

### **Test Scenario 3: User Count Accuracy** 👥
**Objective**: Verify user counting shows correct numbers

**Steps**:
1. Start with 1 user in room
2. Add second user, note count
3. Check admin dashboard user count
4. Add third user, verify count updates

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Shows "1 online" when 2 users connected (excluding self)
- [ ] Admin dashboard matches client display
- [ ] Counts update accurately when users join/leave
- [ ] No double-counting issues

### **Test Scenario 4: Mobile Compatibility** 📱
**Objective**: Verify P2P works on mobile devices

**Steps**:
1. Join room on **desktop browser**
2. Join same room on **mobile device** (iOS/Android)
3. Verify P2P auto-upgrade on both
4. Test message exchange

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Mobile device triggers P2P upgrade
- [ ] Cross-platform P2P connection works
- [ ] Mobile shows correct debug logs
- [ ] Performance remains smooth on mobile

### **Test Scenario 5: QR Code Integration** 📱
**Objective**: Verify QR codes work with P2P upgrade

**Steps**:
1. User 1 creates room and generates QR code
2. User 2 scans QR code to join
3. Verify auto-upgrade triggers after QR join
4. Test P2P messaging

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] QR code join works seamlessly
- [ ] P2P upgrade triggers after QR join
- [ ] No conflicts between QR and P2P systems
- [ ] Host peer detection works correctly

### **Test Scenario 6: Network Resilience** 🌐
**Objective**: Test P2P behavior under network stress

**Steps**:
1. Establish P2P connection
2. Temporarily disconnect/reconnect WiFi on one device
3. Test P2P recovery behavior
4. Verify fallback to WebSocket if needed

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] P2P attempts to reconnect automatically
- [ ] Falls back to WebSocket gracefully
- [ ] Re-establishes P2P when network stable
- [ ] No message loss during transitions

## 🔍 Debug Monitoring

### **Key Log Patterns to Watch**:

**Successful Auto-Upgrade**:
```
🚀 [INSTANT P2P] WebRTC offer detected from: [socketId]
🎯 [INSTANT P2P] Auto-upgrading due to WebRTC signaling activity
🔍 [PEER DISCOVERY] Discovered 1 WebRTC peers
✅ [CONNECT ALL] Connection results: 1/1 successful
✅ Data channel opened to [username]
🔄 WebRTC connection state to [username]: connected
```

**Failed Auto-Upgrade** (troubleshoot if seen):
```
❌ [P2P UPGRADE] Conditions not met for P2P upgrade
⚠️ Received offer from unknown peer
🚫 [AUTO-UPGRADE] P2P unstable, skipping upgrade attempt
```

### **Server-Side Monitoring**:
- Check Cloud Run logs for WebRTC signaling
- Monitor admin analytics for P2P connection metrics
- Watch for increased P2P attempt counts
- Verify mesh networking statistics

### **Admin Dashboard Checks**:
- Navigate to `/admin-analytics` on staging
- Check "Mesh Status" shows active P2P connections
- Verify user counts are accurate
- Monitor connection quality metrics

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

### **If Auto-Upgrade Doesn't Trigger**:
1. Check if WebSocket connection established first
2. Verify WebRTC signaling events in console
3. Look for "meshEnabled: true" in debug logs
4. Check network environment allows WebRTC

### **If P2P Connection Fails**:
1. Verify ICE candidate exchange in logs
2. Check for NAT/firewall restrictions
3. Test on different network (mobile hotspot)
4. Confirm both devices support WebRTC

### **If User Counts Wrong**:
1. Check hybrid status calculation logs
2. Verify WebSocket peer detection
3. Look for double-counting in status display
4. Compare client vs admin dashboard counts

## ✅ Success Metrics

### **Performance Targets**:
- **Auto-upgrade time**: < 3 seconds
- **P2P connection time**: < 5 seconds total
- **Message latency**: < 100ms via P2P
- **Success rate**: > 90% on modern browsers

### **Compatibility Targets**:
- **Desktop**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Mobile**: iOS Safari, Android Chrome
- **Network**: WiFi and cellular (4G/5G)
- **Devices**: Phone, tablet, laptop, desktop

## 🎉 Expected Staging Results

If staging tests pass, you should see:
- **Instant P2P upgrade** working reliably
- **Accurate user counting** in UI and admin dashboard
- **Smooth message exchange** via P2P connections
- **Mobile compatibility** across devices
- **QR code integration** working seamlessly

This will validate the P2P automatic upgrade feature is ready for **production deployment**! 🚀

**Next Steps After Staging Success**:
1. Monitor staging performance for 24-48 hours
2. Gather user feedback if available
3. Document any edge cases discovered
4. Prepare for production deployment with `npm run deploy:vercel:complete`
