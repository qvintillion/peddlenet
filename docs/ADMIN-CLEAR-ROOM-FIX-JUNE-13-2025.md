# 🛠️ Admin Dashboard Clear Room Fix - June 13, 2025

## 🎯 Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Admin dashboard was showing 405 errors when trying to:
- Clear room messages
- Users and rooms modals showing no data

**Root Cause**: Admin analytics page was calling wrong API endpoint

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Clear Room API Endpoint
**File**: `src/app/admin-analytics/page.tsx`

**Before** (Line 432):
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/admin/room', {
  method: 'DELETE',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Basic ${btoa(\`\${credentials.username}:\${credentials.password}\`)}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ roomCode })
});
```

**After**:
```typescript
const response = await fetch(\`/api/admin/room/\${roomCode}/messages\`, {
  method: 'DELETE',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': \`Basic \${btoa(\`\${credentials.username}:\${credentials.password}\`)}\`
  }
});
```

### 2. API Endpoint Structure
- ❌ **Wrong**: `/api/admin/room` (doesn't exist)
- ✅ **Correct**: `/api/admin/room/[roomId]/messages` (exists)

## 🧪 Test Deployment

Deploy to staging first:
```bash
npm run preview:deploy admin-clear-room-fix
```

## ✅ Expected Results

After this fix:
1. **Clear Room Messages** button should work without 405 errors
2. **Broadcast Messages** should continue working (already functional)
3. **User/Room Detail Modals** should show data (depends on WebSocket server)

## 🚀 Production Deployment

Once tested in staging:
```bash
npm run deploy:vercel:complete
```

## 📊 Monitoring

- Check browser console for 405 errors (should be gone)
- Verify clear room functionality in admin dashboard
- Test broadcast messages still work
- Check user/room modals (may still show empty if WebSocket server offline)

## 🔍 Additional Notes

The admin hook (`use-admin-analytics.ts`) was already using the correct endpoint. The issue was specifically in the admin-analytics page component making direct API calls.

**Status**: ✅ Ready for staging deployment  
**Impact**: Fixes critical admin dashboard functionality  
**Risk**: Low - only changes API endpoint URL format
