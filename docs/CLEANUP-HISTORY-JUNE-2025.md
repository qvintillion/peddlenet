# 🧹 Project Cleanup History - June 2025

## 📋 Overview
This document consolidates all cleanup activities performed in June 2025 to maintain a clean, production-ready codebase.

## ✅ Completed Cleanups

### **Scripts & Files Removed**
The following temporary debugging files were safely removed:

**Root Directory Cleanup:**
- `cleanup-temp-scripts.sh` - Temporary cleanup script
- `delete-temp.sh` - Marked as deleted
- `make-executable.sh` - Marked as deleted  
- `debug-build.sh` - Temporary debugging script
- `debug-env.sh.backup` - Environment debugging backup
- `debug-env.sh.delete` - Marked for deletion
- `simple-ssr-fix.sh` - Temporary SSR fix
- `ssr-fix-deploy.sh` - Temporary deployment script
- `nuclear-preview-deploy.sh` - Temporary preview script

**Docker Files Cleanup:**
- `Dockerfile.test` - Temporary testing dockerfile
- `Dockerfile.simple` - Simplified dockerfile (temporary)
- `package-websocket.json` - Temporary WebSocket package config

**Deployment Files Cleanup:**
- `deployment/cloudbuild-test.yaml` - Temporary Cloud Build config
- `deployment/cloudbuild-debug.yaml` - Debugging Cloud Build config  
- `deployment/cloudbuild-simple.yaml` - Simplified Cloud Build config

**Documentation Cleanup:**
- `CLEANUP-COMPLETE-JUNE-2025.md` → Integrated into this document
- `CLEANUP-NOTES.md` → Integrated into this document
- `ENVIRONMENT-ISOLATION-FIX.md` → Integrated into main deployment docs
- `TEMP-FILES-TO-DELETE.md` → Integrated into this document

### **Production Files Kept**
The following files remain as they are actively used:

**Core Deployment:**
- `deployment/cloudbuild-final.yaml` ✅ **Working Cloud Build config**
- `deployment/Dockerfile.cloudrun` ✅ **Production Dockerfile**
- `deployment/package.json` ✅ **Server dependencies**
- `signaling-server-production.js` ✅ **Main server with all fixes**
- `.gcloudignore` ✅ **Controls Cloud Build uploads**

**Active Scripts:**
- `deploy.sh` ✅ **Production deployment to GitHub**
- `preview-staging-ssr.sh` ✅ **Preview staging script**

## 🔧 Environment Isolation Fix Summary

### **Problem Solved**
Staging and preview deployments were connecting to production servers due to environment variable contamination.

### **Solution Implemented**
1. **Improved deployment scripts** with proper backup/restore of `.env.local`
2. **Enhanced environment detection** in `server-utils.ts`
3. **Clear separation** between preview, staging, and production environments

### **Current Workflow**
```bash
# Local Development
npm run dev:mobile

# Preview Staging  
npm run preview:deploy feature-name

# Staging Pre-Production
npm run deploy:firebase:complete

# Production Deploy
./deploy.sh
```

## 🚀 WebSocket Server Fixes

### **CORS & API Fixes Completed**
- ✅ **CORS Fix**: Firebase preview domains fully supported
- ✅ **API Endpoints**: All required endpoints available (`/health`, `/rooms`, `/room-stats`)
- ✅ **Data Format Issues**: Fixed JavaScript errors in peer connections
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Prevents infinite reconnection loops
- ✅ **Cloud Run Optimization**: Better cold start handling

### **Current WebSocket Server**
- **Version**: `1.2.2-api-endpoints-fix`
- **URL**: `https://peddlenet-websocket-server-padyxgyv5a-uc.a.run.app`
- **Status**: Production ready with all fixes applied

## 📚 Documentation Updates

### **Documentation Reorganized**
- Consolidated cleanup documentation into this single file
- Updated `DEPLOYMENT-WORKFLOW.md` with current process
- Integrated environment isolation fixes into main deployment guide
- Removed redundant and temporary documentation files

### **Current Documentation Structure**

## 🎯 Current Production Status

**✅ Codebase State:**
- Clean root directory with only production files
- Streamlined deployment scripts
- Complete CORS and API fixes applied
- Updated documentation reflecting current state
- Clear separation of development, preview, staging, and production

**✅ Deployment Workflow:**
- Four-tier strategy: Local → Preview → Staging → Production
- Environment isolation working correctly  
- WebSocket server fully operational
- All deployment scripts functional

**✅ Ready for Development:**
The codebase is now clean and ready for new feature development with:
- No temporary or debugging files cluttering the root
- Clear deployment process documented
- All environments properly isolated
- Production-ready WebSocket server

## 🔍 Maintenance Notes

### **Future Cleanup Principles**
1. **Keep root directory clean** - move debugging files to `/tmp` or `/debug` folders
2. **Document temporary files** - clearly mark what can be deleted
3. **Integrate fixes into main docs** - avoid scattered documentation
4. **Use proper environment isolation** - prevent contamination between environments

### **Recommended Cleanup Schedule**
- **Weekly**: Check for temporary files in root directory
- **Monthly**: Review and consolidate documentation
- **After major fixes**: Integrate learnings into main documentation
- **Before releases**: Ensure clean state for production deployment
