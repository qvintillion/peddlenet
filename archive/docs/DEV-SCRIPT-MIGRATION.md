# 🚀 Development Script Migration

## ✅ Updated Main Script

The main development script has been **upgraded** with automatic IP detection and duplicate connection prevention.

### 🔄 What Changed

**Old**: `./tools/dev-mobile-improved.sh`  
**New**: `./tools/dev-mobile.sh` ← **This is now the main script**

### 🚀 New Features

- **Automatic IP Detection**: Fresh detection every time you run the script
- **No More Duplicates**: Eliminated the "2 online" issue  
- **Better Logging**: Connection IDs and detailed status
- **Network Change Handling**: Just restart script when IP changes
- **Verbose Mode**: Use `--verbose` flag for detailed network info

### 💻 Usage

```bash
# Main development command (replaces old script)
./tools/dev-mobile.sh

# With detailed network information
./tools/dev-mobile.sh --verbose
```

### 📂 File Changes

- `tools/dev-mobile.sh` ← **New main script** (upgraded)
- `tools/dev-mobile-old.sh` ← Backup of previous version
- `tools/detect-ip.js` ← New reliable IP detection utility

The old scripts are preserved as backups, but the main `dev-mobile.sh` script is now the improved version with all the latest fixes.

### 🎯 Benefits

- **Cleaner mobile connections** (exactly 1 per device)
- **Automatic IP handling** (no manual configuration)
- **Better development experience** (reliable startup every time)
- **Consistent with README** (main script is properly documented)
