2. **Create Room**: Enter any room name → auto-join
3. **Share**: Click "📱 Invite" → generate QR code
4. **Connect**: Others scan QR to join instantly

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Current: Production P2P
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript
- **P2P Layer**: WebRTC with persistent peer management
