echo "🧪 Testing QR Connection Fix"
echo "============================"
echo ""
echo "📋 What was fixed:"
echo "   ❌ Before: QR codes used stable peer IDs (stable-50416d09)"
echo "   ✅ After:  QR codes use actual peer IDs (da90bf3d-7cd9-4260-8953-8aa7f02288ca)"
echo ""
echo "🔍 How to test:"
echo "   1. Start the app: npm run dev:mobile"
echo "   2. Create a room on desktop"
echo "   3. Generate QR code (📱 Invite button)"
echo "   4. Check console logs:"
echo "      - Should show: '📱 Generated invite QR with ACTUAL peer info: [actual-peer-id]'"
echo "      - QR URL should contain the actual peer ID"
echo "   5. Scan with mobile"
echo "   6. Mobile console should show:"
echo "      - '📱 Found host peer info in URL: [actual-peer-id]'"
echo "      - '📱 Will attempt connection to host peer in 3 seconds...'"
echo "      - Connection should succeed"
echo ""
echo "🎯 Expected result:"
echo "   ✅ Mobile connects to desktop in 5-10 seconds"
echo "   ✅ Messages sync between devices"
echo "   ✅ No 'peer-unavailable' errors"
echo ""
echo "🐛 If still not working, check:"
echo "   • Both devices on same WiFi"
echo "   • HTTPS tunnel is working (ngrok)"
echo "   • No firewall blocking WebRTC"
echo "   • Enable debug panel to see connection details"
