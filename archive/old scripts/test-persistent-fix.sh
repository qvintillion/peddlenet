echo "🔧 Testing React Effect Fix"
echo "=========================="
echo ""

echo "📋 What we fixed:"
echo "   ❌ React was immediately cleaning up PeerJS connections"
echo "   ✅ Now storing peer globally to survive React cleanup"
echo ""

echo "🧪 Test the persistent version:"
echo "   1. Refresh: https://your-ngrok.io/test-room"
echo "   2. Watch console logs carefully"
echo ""

echo "✅ Expected behavior (GOOD):"
echo "   🚀 Creating persistent P2P for room: test-room"
echo "   🔧 Creating persistent PeerJS instance..."
echo "   ✅ Persistent P2P ready with peer ID: abc123..."
echo "   🚫 React wants to cleanup, but keeping peer alive"
echo "   [NO peer recreation after this]"
echo ""

echo "❌ If you still see (BAD):"
echo "   🧹 Cleaning up PeerJS"
echo "   🔒 PeerJS closed"
echo "   [Multiple peer recreations]"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Testing steps:"
echo "   1. Desktop: Open test page"
echo "   2. Wait 10 seconds - peer should stay stable"
echo "   3. Copy peer ID from console"
echo "   4. Mobile: Open same test page"
echo "   5. Mobile: Manual Connect → paste peer ID"
echo "   6. Should connect successfully!"
echo ""

echo "📱 If this works, we can apply the same fix to the main chat page."
echo ""

echo "🚀 Go test it now!"
