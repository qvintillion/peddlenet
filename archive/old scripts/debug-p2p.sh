echo "üìã STEP 1: Clear old data and test basic setup"
echo "   This will clear localStorage and test with simplified P2P"
echo ""
echo "   What to do:"
echo "   1. Open browser console (F12)"
echo "   2. Run this command to clear old data:"
echo "      localStorage.clear(); location.reload();"
echo "   3. Check console for peer initialization logs"

echo "   Test URL (add to end of your ngrok URL):"
echo "   /chat/test-room"
echo ""
echo "   Example: https://abc123.ngrok.io/chat/test-room"

echo "   What to look for:"
echo "   ‚úÖ Single '‚úÖ P2P ready with peer ID:' message"
echo "   ‚ùå Multiple peer recreations"

echo "üìã STEP 3: Test manual connection first"
echo "   Before testing QR codes, verify P2P works manually"
echo ""
echo "   Instructions:"
echo "   1. Desktop: Open test room, copy peer ID"
echo "   2. Mobile: Open same test room"
echo "   3. Mobile: Click 'Manual Connect'"
echo "   4. Mobile: Paste peer ID and connect"
echo "   5. Watch for '‚úÖ Connected to host via QR!' message"

echo "   Expected result: Manual connection should work"

echo "üìã STEP 4: Test QR connection"

echo "   Instructions:"
echo "   1. Desktop: Generate QR code"
echo "   2. Mobile: Scan QR code"
echo "   3. Check console for connection attempt"

echo "   Common issues:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ QR contains old/invalid peer ID"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Peer recreated after QR generation"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Network/tunnel instability"
echo ""

echo "üìã STEP 5: Check network stability"
echo "   Test if ngrok tunnel is stable"
echo ""
echo "   What to check:"
echo "   1. Visit ngrok dashboard: http://localhost:4040"
echo "   2. Check for tunnel disconnections"
echo "   3. Try different ngrok region:"
echo "      ngrok http 3000 --region=eu"
echo "   4. Test with multiple browser tabs"

echo ""
echo "If manual connection fails:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Check both devices are using HTTPS"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Verify firewall isn't blocking WebRTC"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Try different WiFi network"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Check browser compatibility"
echo ""
echo "If QR connection fails but manual works:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ QR peer ID doesn't match actual peer ID"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Peer recreated after QR generation"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ URL parsing issues"
echo ""
echo "If peer keeps recreating:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ React StrictMode (check layout.tsx)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Effect dependencies causing re-runs"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ ngrok tunnel instability"
echo ""
echo "üöÄ Quick fixes to try:"
echo "   1. Use test page: /chat/test-room"
echo "   2. Clear localStorage completely"
echo "   3. Restart ngrok tunnel"
echo "   4. Try different browser"
echo "   5. Test on same device (two tabs)"
