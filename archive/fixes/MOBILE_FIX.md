# 🔧 Quick Fix for dev:mobile Issues

## What Happened
Your `npm run dev:mobile` was working perfectly until we disconnected from staging. The issue was React infinite loops in the page component, not the mobile development setup itself.

## The Fix Applied ✅

### 1. Fixed React Infinite Loops
The main issue was in `/src/app/chat/[roomId]/page.tsx` where useEffect dependencies were causing infinite re-renders.

**Fixed:**
- Removed `connectionError` from useEffect dependencies that modify `connectionError`
- Added connection cooldown to prevent retry spam

### 2. Preserved Your Working Mobile Setup
- Your `dev:mobile` script is still intact and should work perfectly
- The SQLite server setup remains unchanged
- Mobile IP detection and QR code functionality preserved

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Stop any running processes:**
```bash
# Kill any existing Next.js or server processes
pkill -f "next"
pkill -f "node.*3001"
```

2. **Clear browser state (important!):**
- Open DevTools → Application → Clear Storage → Clear site data
- Or just hard refresh with Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) / Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)

3. **Start with your usual command:**
```bash
npm run dev:mobile
```

## What You Should See Now

✅ **Terminal Output:**
```
🌐 Detecting network IP for mobile development...
✅ Detected local IP: 192.168.1.66
🚀 Starting development servers with SQLite persistence...
📱 Mobile URLs:
   App: http://192.168.1.66:3000
   ...
```

✅ **Browser Console:** 
- No more "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors
- No more infinite "ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED" loops
- Should see: "🚀 Connected to chat server"

✅ **App Behavior:**
- Clean connection status display
- QR codes should work for mobile connections
- Messages persist with SQLite

## If Still Having Issues

1. **Check the terminal** - both Next.js and SQLite server should start
2. **Check browser console** - should be much cleaner now
3. **Try the diagnostics page:** `http://192.168.1.66:3000/diagnostics`

Your original workflow should now work as expected! 🎉
