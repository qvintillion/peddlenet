# 🔧 Room Code Join Fix - Server-Side Resolution

## 🐛 **Problem Fixed**
In staging, entering a room code was creating a new room instead of joining the existing room.

## ⚡ **Root Cause**
Room codes were only stored locally in `localStorage`, so when User B tried to join a room created by User A using a room code, User B's browser had no mapping and treated the code as a new room ID.

## 🛠️ **Solution Applied**

### Server-Side Changes (`signaling-server.js`)
1. **Added room code storage**: `const roomCodes = new Map()` to store code → roomId mappings
2. **Added API endpoints**:
   - `GET /resolve-room-code/:code` - Look up roomId from room code
   - `POST /register-room-code` - Register new room code mappings
3. **Enhanced cleanup**: Room codes are cleaned up with their associated rooms

### Client-Side Changes (`room-codes.ts`)
1. **Server lookup**: `getRoomIdFromCode()` now checks server first, then localStorage cache
2. **Server registration**: `storeCodeMapping()` now registers codes with server
3. **Async handling**: Room code operations are now async to support server calls

### UI Changes (`RoomCode.tsx`)
1. **Async join**: Room joining now waits for server lookup
2. **Async registration**: Room codes are registered with server when displayed

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### Creating a Room:
1. User A creates room "main-stage-vip" 
2. System generates code "blue-stage-42"
3. Code is stored locally AND registered with server
4. Server maps: `"blue-stage-42" → "main-stage-vip"`

### Joining a Room:
1. User B enters code "blue-stage-42"
2. System checks localStorage (cache miss)
3. System queries server: `GET /resolve-room-code/blue-stage-42`
4. Server returns: `{"success": true, "roomId": "main-stage-vip"}`
5. User B joins existing room "main-stage-vip" ✅

## 🚀 **Testing**

To verify the fix:

1. **Start servers**: `npm run dev:mobile`
2. **Create room**: Open browser A, create "Test Room"
3. **Note room code**: e.g., "magic-vibe-42"
4. **Join from another browser**: Open browser B, enter "magic-vibe-42"
5. **Expected result**: Browser B joins the same room as browser A

## 📊 **Fallback Behavior**

- If server is offline: Falls back to localStorage-only (same as before)
- If code not found: Creates new room with slugified code (same as before)
- Backward compatible: Existing localStorage mappings still work

## 🎉 **Result**

Room codes now work across different devices/browsers as intended! The staging issue is resolved.
