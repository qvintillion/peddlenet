# 🎉 Festival Chat - Room Code Fix Deployment Complete

## 🐛 **Issue Resolved**
**Problem**: In staging, entering a room code was creating a new room instead of joining the existing room.

**Root Cause**: Room codes were only stored in localStorage, so users couldn't join rooms created by others.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **Server-Side Room Code Resolution**
- Added `roomCodes` Map for server-side storage in `signaling-server.js`
- New API endpoints:
  - `GET /resolve-room-code/:code` - Look up existing room codes
  - `POST /register-room-code` - Register new room code mappings
- Automatic cleanup when rooms expire

### **Client-Side Enhancements**
- Enhanced `RoomCodeManager.getRoomIdFromCode()` for async server lookup
- Updated `RoomCodeManager.storeCodeMapping()` to register with server
- Modified `RoomCodeJoin` component for async room joining
- Added server URL detection for API calls

### **Deployment Fixes**
- Fixed Node.js version in `package.json` from `>=18.0.0` to `18`
- Created Cloud Run compatible `Dockerfile` with proper port handling
- Updated deployment scripts for correct port configuration

## 🚀 **Deployment Method Used**
```bash
./tools/deploy-complete.sh
```
- Deployed enhanced signaling server to Google Cloud Run
- Updated Firebase with new WebSocket server URL
- Full stack deployment with health checks

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **Creating a Room:**
1. User A creates room "main-stage-vip" → generates code "blue-stage-42"
2. Code stored locally AND registered with server
3. Server maps: `"blue-stage-42" → "main-stage-vip"`

### **Joining a Room:**
1. User B enters code "blue-stage-42"
2. System checks localStorage (cache miss)
3. System queries server: `GET /resolve-room-code/blue-stage-42`
4. Server returns: `{"success": true, "roomId": "main-stage-vip"}`
5. User B joins existing room "main-stage-vip" ✅

## 🧪 **Testing Verification**
1. Open two different browsers/devices
2. Create room in browser A, note room code (e.g., "magic-vibe-42")
3. Enter same code in browser B
4. ✅ **Expected Result**: Browser B joins same room as browser A

## 📁 **Files Modified**
- `signaling-server.js` - Added room code storage and API endpoints
- `src/utils/room-codes.ts` - Enhanced with server lookup functionality
- `src/components/RoomCode.tsx` - Updated for async room code resolution
- `package.json` - Fixed Node.js version for Firebase Functions
- `Dockerfile` - Created Cloud Run compatible container
- `tools/deploy-complete.sh` - Used for full stack deployment

## 🌐 **Deployment URLs**
- **Firebase Frontend**: https://festival-chat-peddlenet.web.app
- **Cloud Run Backend**: [Generated during deployment]
- **Health Check**: [Cloud Run URL]/health

## 🎉 **Result**
Room codes now work reliably across different devices and browsers! The staging issue where room codes created new rooms instead of joining existing ones is completely resolved.

## 🔄 **Fallback Behavior**
- If server offline: Falls back to localStorage-only
- If code not found: Creates new room with slugified code
- Backward compatible: Existing localStorage mappings still work
