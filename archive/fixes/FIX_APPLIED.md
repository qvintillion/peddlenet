# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FIX APPLIED

## Issue Fixed
The app was experiencing infinite React re-renders due to problematic useEffect dependencies and missing WebSocket server.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. React Infinite Loop Fixed âœ…
- Removed `connectionError` from useEffect dependencies that were causing infinite loops
- Added connection cooldown to prevent connection spam
- Improved WebSocket hook memoization

### 2. Missing Server Issue âœ…
- The WebSocket server wasn't running alongside the Next.js app
- Added new scripts to run both simultaneously

## How to Run Now

### Option 1: Use the new combined script (Recommended)
```bash
npm run dev:with-server
```

### Option 2: Manual startup (two terminals)
Terminal 1:
```bash
npm run server
```

Terminal 2:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Option 3: Use the full development script
```bash
npm run dev:full
```

## What You Should See

1. **Terminal Output**: Both servers starting successfully
2. **Browser Console**: No more infinite error loops
3. **Connection Status**: Should show "Connected to server" instead of endless connection attempts

## If Issues Persist

1. **Kill any existing processes**:
```bash
pkill -f "node.*3001"
pkill -f "next"
```

2. **Clear browser cache and localStorage**:
- Open DevTools â†’ Application â†’ Clear Storage â†’ Clear site data

3. **Restart with the proper command**:
```bash
npm run dev:with-server
```

## Key Changes Made

- Fixed infinite useEffect loops in `page.tsx`
- Added connection cooldown in WebSocket hook
- Created proper server startup scripts
- Improved error handling and logging

The app should now work smoothly without the endless error spam! ðŸŽ‰
