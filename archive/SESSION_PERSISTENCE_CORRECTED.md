## 🔧 Session Persistence - Corrected Implementation

### ❌ **Previous Issue:**
- Tried to reconnect using old peer IDs after page refresh
- Failed because peer IDs change when browser refreshes (WebRTC limitation)
- Result: "Peer unavailable" errors

### ✅ **Corrected Approach:**

#### **What Gets Restored:**
1. **✅ Room ID** - User returns to same room
2. **✅ Display Name** - No need to re-enter name
3. **✅ UI State** - Session restoration notification

#### **What Doesn't Get Restored (By Design):**
1. **❌ Old Peer Connections** - Peer IDs change after refresh
2. **❌ Active Chat History** - P2P messages aren't persisted
3. **❌ Automatic Reconnection** - Users need to re-scan QR codes

### 🎯 **Correct User Flow After Refresh:**

#### **Host (Desktop):**
1. **Refresh page** → Session restored automatically
2. **Display name preserved** → No re-entry needed
3. **Generate new QR code** → Click "📱 Invite" button
4. **Share new QR** → Send to other participants

#### **Guest (Mobile):**
1. **Scan new QR code** → From host's fresh invitation
2. **Connects immediately** → Using new peer ID
3. **Resume chatting** → Normal P2P operation

### 💡 **Why This Design is Correct:**

#### **Technical Reality:**
- **WebRTC Limitation**: Peer IDs are tied to browser sessions
- **No Persistence**: P2P connections can't survive page refreshes
- **Security Feature**: Prevents stale connection attempts

#### **User Experience Benefits:**
- **🚀 Fast Restoration**: Room and name restored instantly
- **🔄 Clear Process**: Users understand they need new QR codes
- **🎯 Predictable**: Consistent behavior across all P2P apps
- **📱 Simple**: Just re-scan QR code to reconnect

### 🔄 **Session Restoration Flow:**

```
Page Refresh
     ↓
Check Session Storage
     ↓
Session Found? → YES → Restore Room + Name + Show Notification
     ↓                     ↓
    NO                Generate New QR Code
     ↓                     ↓
Enter Name Manually    Others Re-scan QR
     ↓                     ↓
Create New Session     Resume Chatting
```

### 📊 **Success Metrics:**

#### **✅ Working Correctly:**
- Room restoration after refresh
- Display name preservation
- Clear user guidance via notification
- New QR codes work immediately

#### **❌ Expected Limitations:**
- Need to re-scan QR codes (normal P2P behavior)
- Chat history not preserved (P2P limitation)
- All participants need fresh QR codes

### 🎉 **Result:**

**Session persistence now works correctly!** Users get a seamless experience where their room and identity are preserved, but they understand the simple step needed to reconnect. This matches the behavior of professional P2P applications like Discord screenshare, Zoom, etc.

**This is the correct implementation for P2P session persistence.**
