# ðŸ§¹ Project Cleanup: Using Existing Scripts

This file was replaced to keep the project structure clean.

**Use the existing script instead:**
```bash
./scripts/deploy-websocket-cloudbuild.sh
```

This provides the same WebSocket server deployment functionality with the CORS fixes.

**Keeping it clean!** ðŸš€
