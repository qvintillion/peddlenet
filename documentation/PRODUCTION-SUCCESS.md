## 🚀 Next Phase: Mesh Network Evolution

### Current: Simple P2P (1-to-1 and small groups)
```
Device A ←→ Device B
Device A ←→ Device C
Device B ←→ Device C
```

### Next: True Mesh Network (Auto-discovery & routing)
```
Device A ←→ Device B ←→ Device D
    ↕         ↕         ↕
Device C ←→ Device E ←→ Device F
```
