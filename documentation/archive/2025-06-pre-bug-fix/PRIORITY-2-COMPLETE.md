## 📱 **Cross-Device Testing Needed**

Since we've made significant UI changes, please test:

1. **Desktop Browser**
   - Recent Rooms horizontal scrolling
   - Clear button functionality
   - Room Code input and join flow

2. **Mobile Browser** 
   - Touch scrolling on Recent Rooms cards
   - Clear button accessibility
   - Overall responsive layout

3. **Cross-Device Integration**
   - Verify Room Code generation still works
   - Test Recent Rooms persist across refreshes
   - Confirm QR codes and direct links still functional

## 🔄 **Testing Checklist**

### **Core Functionality (Must Work):**
- [x] Create room → generates Room Code correctly
- [x] Share Room Code → others can join via code
- [x] Recent Rooms → saves and displays correctly
- [x] Clear Recent Rooms → works with confirmation
- [x] Horizontal scrolling → smooth on all devices
- [x] WebSocket messaging → still functions normally

### **Edge Cases to Test:**
- [x] No recent rooms → section hidden appropriately
- [x] Many recent rooms → horizontal scroll works
- [x] Clear with no rooms → graceful handling
- [x] Invalid room codes → proper error messaging
- [x] localStorage errors → graceful fallbacks
