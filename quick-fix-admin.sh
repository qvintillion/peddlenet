🔧 Admin Dashboard Fix - Vercel API Routes

Fixed admin dashboard 404 errors by creating proper Vercel API routes and updating client-side API path detection.

🎯 ADMIN API FIXES:
• Created /api/admin/analytics - Main dashboard data endpoint
• Created /api/admin/info - Admin dashboard info endpoint
• Created /api/admin/activity - Live activity feed endpoint
• Created /api/admin/broadcast - Broadcast message endpoint
• All endpoints include proper authentication checks

🔧 TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS:
• Added ServerUtils.getAdminApiPath() for platform detection
• Vercel uses /api/admin/* paths, Cloud Run uses /admin/*
• Updated admin dashboard to use correct API paths
• Automatic platform detection between Vercel and Cloud Run
• Proper CORS headers for all admin API routes

🛡️ AUTHENTICATION:
• All admin routes require Basic Auth (th3p3ddl3r / letsmakeatrade)
• Session management preserved for frontend
• Environment variable support for custom credentials
• Proper 401 responses with WWW-Authenticate headers

✅ RESULT:
• Admin dashboard now loads on Vercel production
• Authentication works correctly
• Basic admin functionality restored
• Room creation and admin dashboard both working

Note: Some advanced features require WebSocket server integration
