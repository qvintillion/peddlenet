if (hasActiveSubscriptions) {
  this.connect();
} else {
  console.log('No active subscriptions - skipping connection');
}
```

#### **Favorites with Notification Integration**
```typescript
// Favoriting automatically enables notifications
const handleToggleFavorite = () => {
  if (!isFavorite) {
    // Add to favorites AND subscribe to notifications
    subscribeToRoom(roomId, displayName);
    setIsFavorite(true);
  }
};
```

#### **Rate Limiting & Backoff**
```typescript
// Exponential backoff prevents server overload
const delay = Math.min(baseDelay * Math.pow(2, attempts), maxDelay);
```
