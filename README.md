- Enables QR code scanning from mobile devices
- Sets up real-time messaging with persistence

### For Standard Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 📱 Mobile Testing

1. **Start servers:** `npm run dev:mobile`
2. **Check IP detection:** Should show "✅ Detected local IP: 192.168.x.x"
3. **Test on mobile:** Open `http://YOUR_IP:3000/diagnostics`
4. **Join rooms:** Scan QR codes for instant connections

## ✨ Features

## 🌐 Environment Variables

### Development
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DETECTED_IP`: Local network IP (auto-set by dev:mobile)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SIGNALING_SERVER`: Override server URL (optional)
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3001)

### Production
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SIGNALING_SERVER`: Production server URL (WSS format)
  - Example: `wss://peddlenet-websocket-server-hfttiarlja-uc.a.run.app`
  - ServerUtils automatically converts to HTTPS for API calls
- `NODE_ENV`: Next.js environment (`production` for optimized builds)
- `BUILD_TARGET`: Our custom environment detection (`development`, `staging`, `production`)
- `PLATFORM`: Auto-detected by universal server (`cloudrun`, `firebase`, `vercel`)

## 🔧 Network Requirements

**Both devices must be on the same WiFi network:**
- Router client isolation: **DISABLED**
- Firewall ports 3000 & 3001: **ALLOWED**
- Network type: **Private WiFi** (not guest networks)

**✅ Compatible Networks:**
- Home WiFi (WPA2/WPA3)
- Mobile hotspot
- Coffee shop WiFi (usually)

**❌ Incompatible Networks:**
- Corporate networks (firewall restrictions)
- Hotel WiFi (client isolation)
- Public WiFi with captive portals

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Quick Diagnosis
```bash
npm run dev:mobile
# Open http://YOUR_IP:3000/diagnostics on mobile
```

### Connection Test Results
The diagnostics page will show:
- ✅ **Environment Badge:** Development/Production
- ✅ **Frontend Access:** Basic connectivity
- ✅ **Server Health (HTTP):** API endpoint connectivity  
- ✅ **WebSocket Connection:** Real-time messaging capability

### Common Issues

**Connection Loss/Drops:**
- ✅ **Auto-reconnection enabled** - No manual refresh needed
- The app now automatically reconnects within 3 seconds of any disconnect
- Watch for "Reconnecting..." status with yellow pulsing indicator
- Health monitoring runs every 30 seconds to catch silent disconnections

**"Server Offline" on Mobile:**
- Ensure both devices on same WiFi network
- Check IP detection shows network IP (not localhost)
- Test server health: `http://YOUR_IP:3001/health`
- Disable firewall temporarily

**Admin Dashboard Issues:**
- ✅ **Sessions persist across refreshes** - No need to re-login constantly
- ✅ **Activity feed retains data** - Use clear button to manually reset
- ✅ **User/Room modals work** - No more authentication errors
- Access at: `/admin-analytics` with credentials: `th3p3ddl3r` / `letsmakeatrade`

**QR Code Shows "localhost":**
- Use `npm run dev:mobile` (not `npm run dev`)
- Verify WiFi connection and IP detection

**Room Code Registration Failing:**
- Deploy updated server: `npm run deploy:firebase:complete`
- The production server needs the latest endpoints
