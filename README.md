## 🔧 Development Workflow

### **4-Tier Deployment Workflow**

#### **1. Development (Local) 🏠**
```bash
npm run dev:mobile
```
- **Purpose:** Fast UI iteration and component testing
- **Environment:** Local (localhost + network IP)
- **WebSocket:** `localhost:3001` (auto-detected)
- **Admin Dashboard:** `http://localhost:3000/admin-analytics`
- **Benefits:** Fast startup, good for UI work, mobile QR testing

#### **2. Preview Channels (Quick Testing) 🎆**
```bash
npm run preview:deploy feature-name
```
- **Purpose:** Quick testing and stakeholder sharing
- **Environment:** Firebase Preview Channels
- **WebSocket:** Staging server (`wss://peddlenet-websocket-server-staging-*`)
- **Admin Dashboard:** `https://festival-chat--feature-name-[hash].web.app/admin-analytics`
- **Benefits:** Fast deployment, shareable URLs, temporary channels

#### **3. Final Staging (Comprehensive Validation) 🎭**
```bash
npm run deploy:firebase:complete
```
- **Purpose:** Final validation before production deployment
- **Environment:** Firebase Hosting (main staging)
- **WebSocket:** Staging server (`wss://peddlenet-websocket-server-staging-*`)
- **Admin Dashboard:** `https://festival-chat-peddlenet.web.app/admin-analytics`
- **Benefits:** Complete testing, production-like conditions

#### **4. Production (Vercel) 🚀**
```bash
vercel --prod --yes
```
- **Purpose:** Live production deployment
- **Environment:** Vercel production
- **WebSocket:** Production server (`wss://peddlenet-websocket-server-*`)
- **Admin Dashboard:** ✅ **`https://peddlenet.app/admin-analytics` - FULLY WORKING**
- **Benefits:** High performance, edge caching, global CDN

### **WebSocket Server Updates**
The staging and preview channels share the same WebSocket server:

**Staging WebSocket Server** (used by preview channels AND final staging):
```bash
./scripts/deploy-websocket-staging.sh
```

**Production WebSocket Server** (production only):
```bash
./scripts/deploy-websocket-cloudbuild.sh
```

**Note:** Preview channels automatically use the staging WebSocket server - no separate deployment needed!

## 🌐 Environment Variables

### Development
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DETECTED_IP`: Local network IP (auto-set by dev:mobile)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SIGNALING_SERVER`: Override server URL (optional)
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3001)

### Production
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SIGNALING_SERVER`: Production server URL (WSS format)
  - Example: `wss://peddlenet-websocket-server-hfttiarlja-uc.a.run.app`
  - ServerUtils automatically converts to HTTPS for API calls
- `NODE_ENV`: Next.js environment (`production` for optimized builds)
- `BUILD_TARGET`: Our custom environment detection (`development`, `staging`, `production`)
- `PLATFORM`: Auto-detected by universal server (`cloudrun`, `firebase`, `vercel`)

## 🔧 Network Requirements

**Both devices must be on the same WiFi network:**
- Router client isolation: **DISABLED**
- Firewall ports 3000 & 3001: **ALLOWED**
- Network type: **Private WiFi** (not guest networks)

**✅ Compatible Networks:**
- Home WiFi (WPA2/WPA3)
- Mobile hotspot
- Coffee shop WiFi (usually)

**❌ Incompatible Networks:**
- Corporate networks (firewall restrictions)
- Hotel WiFi (client isolation)
- Public WiFi with captive portals

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Quick Diagnosis
```bash
npm run dev:mobile
# Open http://YOUR_IP:3000/diagnostics on mobile
```

### Connection Test Results
The diagnostics page will show:
- ✅ **Environment Badge:** Development/Production
- ✅ **Frontend Access:** Basic connectivity
- ✅ **Server Health (HTTP):** API endpoint connectivity  
- ✅ **WebSocket Connection:** Real-time messaging capability

### Common Issues

**Connection Loss/Drops:**
- ✅ **Auto-reconnection enabled** - No manual refresh needed
- The app now automatically reconnects within 3 seconds of any disconnect
- Watch for "Reconnecting..." status with yellow pulsing indicator
- Health monitoring runs every 30 seconds to catch silent disconnections

**"Server Offline" on Mobile:**
- Ensure both devices on same WiFi network
- Check IP detection shows network IP (not localhost)
- Test server health: `http://YOUR_IP:3001/health`
- Disable firewall temporarily

**Admin Dashboard Issues:** ✅ **ALL RESOLVED**
- ✅ **Sessions persist across refreshes** - 24-hour localStorage sessions
- ✅ **Authentication works correctly** - Proper HTTP Basic Auth headers
- ✅ **Real-time data displays** - Live analytics with graceful fallbacks
- ✅ **Activity feed retains data** - 100 records with manual clear functionality
- ✅ **Admin controls functional** - Broadcasting, room clearing, user management
- ✅ **Mobile responsive** - Touch-optimized for festival staff
- ✅ **Network resilient** - Continues working during server outages

**QR Code Shows "localhost":**
- Use `npm run dev:mobile` (not `npm run dev`)
- Verify WiFi connection and IP detection

**Room Code Registration Failing:**
- Deploy updated server: `npm run deploy:firebase:complete`
- The production server needs the latest endpoints
