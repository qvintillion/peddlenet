echo "üìã Let's check when Tailwind configuration changed..."
echo ""

# Check git history for package.json changes
echo "üîç Recent package.json changes:"
git log --oneline -10 --follow package.json || echo "No git history available"

echo ""
echo "üéØ LIKELY CAUSES:"
echo "================"
echo ""
echo "1. üì¶ PACKAGE UPDATE:"
echo "   - npm update might have upgraded Tailwind to v4 beta"
echo "   - Tailwind v4 has completely different setup than v3"
echo "   - @tailwindcss/postcss doesn't exist in v4"
echo ""
echo "2. üîß CONFIGURATION DRIFT:"
echo "   - Someone updated postcss.config to use @tailwindcss/postcss"
echo "   - This syntax only works with Tailwind v4 alpha/beta"
echo "   - But package.json still had v3 dependencies"
echo ""
echo "3. üåê VERCEL NODE.JS UPDATE:"
echo "   - Vercel might have updated Node.js version"
echo "   - Different dependency resolution behavior"
echo "   - Breaking changes in PostCSS processing"
echo ""
echo "4. üîÑ DEPENDENCY RESOLUTION:"
echo "   - npm install resolved dependencies differently"
echo "   - Package-lock.json conflicts"
echo "   - Peer dependency mismatches"

echo "üîç CHECKING CURRENT STATE:"
echo "========================="

echo "üìÑ Current package.json Tailwind version:"

echo "üéØ WHAT LIKELY HAPPENED:"
echo "======================="
echo ""
echo "‚ùå MOST LIKELY: Package update broke the configuration"
echo "   - Tailwind was updated to v4 (experimental)"
echo "   - PostCSS config was changed to v4 syntax"
echo "   - But the setup was incomplete/incorrect"
echo ""
echo "‚úÖ WHAT WE'RE FIXING:"
echo "   - Reverting to proven Tailwind v3.4.0"
echo "   - Standard PostCSS configuration"
echo "   - Proper dependency structure"
echo ""
echo "üí° WHY NOW:"
echo "=========="
echo "This probably broke during recent dependency updates or"
echo "when someone tried to 'upgrade' to Tailwind v4 without"
echo "realizing it requires a completely different setup."

echo "The fix we're applying restores the WORKING configuration! üîß"
