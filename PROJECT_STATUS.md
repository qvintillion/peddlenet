# 🎯 Project Status: Festival Chat - Production Ready with Protocol Fixes

## 📢 **LATEST UPDATE - Protocol Issues Resolved**

### ✅ **Major Protocol Fixes Implemented** (June 8, 2025)
**Problems Resolved**:
- WSS URLs being used for HTTP API calls causing "URL scheme not supported" errors
- Mixed content errors from HTTPS sites making HTTP requests
- 404 errors for room code registration endpoints
- JSON parse errors from HTML 404 responses

**🔧 Solution Implemented**: New **ServerUtils** system that automatically:
- Converts `wss://` to `https://` for HTTP API calls
- Handles development vs production environments seamlessly  
- Provides centralized URL management for all server communications
- Includes built-in health checking and environment detection

### ✅ **Build System Fixes Applied** (June 8, 2025)
**Build Issues Resolved**:
- Firebase export build failures from webpack chunk corruption
- Headers configuration conflicts with static export mode  
- Next.js trying to use server features in static builds
- Cache corruption causing module not found errors

**🔧 Solution Implemented**: Enhanced build configuration:
- Conditional headers only for non-export builds
- Improved cache cleanup procedures
- Better error recovery and artifact management
- Client-side only operations in ServerUtils

**🚀 Build Status**: ✅ **STABLE** - All build issues resolved, ready for deployment

## 🚀 **Quick Start Guide**

### **For Developers:**
```bash
git clone <repository>
cd festival-chat
npm install
npm run dev:mobile
```

**Expected Console Output:**
```
✅ Detected local IP: 192.168.x.x
🔧 Server Utils loaded - separate HTTP/WebSocket URL management
🌐 Using production HTTP URL: https://...
🌐 Using production WSS URL: wss://...
🎵 Festival Chat Server running on port 3001
💾 SQLite persistence enabled!
```

### **For Mobile Testing:**
1. Start: `npm run dev:mobile`
2. Note the IP: "✅ Detected local IP: 192.168.x.x"
3. Test: Open `http://192.168.x.x:3000/diagnostics` on mobile
4. Verify: All tests should show ✅ (Environment, Frontend, Server Health, WebSocket)
5. Use: Scan QR codes in any chat room
