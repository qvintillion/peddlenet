# Minimal Dockerfile for immediate deployment
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json from root (has all dependencies)
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install only production dependencies 
RUN npm ci --only=production && npm cache clean --force

# Copy the universal server (works for all environments with auto-detection)
COPY signaling-server.js ./server.js

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3001
